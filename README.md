# AceValkyrie Web Portfolio Version 0.1
Portfolio web site for Levi Zelley under the branding of AceValkyrie. Displays important information for potential employers such as resume, education details, projects undertaken, and certifications.
Created by Levi Zelley on 1/4/26.

## Site Use
The site is intended to be found at https://levizelley.acevalkyrie.dev/ and is a simple web page accessible by anyone.  
Functionality includes jump links to get to individual sections, site color theme settings, and pure CSS carousels to tab through different information.

## Upcoming Changes
 - Complete site overhaul
  - CSS needs to be more clearly organized
  - ID and class names need to be clearer
  - Load times are unacceptable
 - SEO optimization
